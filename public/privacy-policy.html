  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>June 2025</strong></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Dropdeck Shopify app ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our app in connection with your Shopify store.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Order Data:</strong> We access order and customer information from your Shopify store to generate the order table and enforce per-customer unit restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Data (Level 2 Protected):</strong> We access customer email addresses and order history solely to check if a customer has exceeded the allowed purchase limit for a product.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display order history and generate the order table within the app interface.</li>
    <li>To enforce unit restrictions by checking a customer's past orders (using their email address) to determine if they are eligible to place a new preorder.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No customer or order data is stored or persisted by the Dropdeck app.</strong></li>
    <li>All data is accessed in real-time from your Shopify store and is not retained after use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not share, sell, or disclose any customer or order data to third parties.</li>
    <li>All data processing occurs solely to provide the app's core functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We use secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS) for all data transmissions between your store and our app.</li>
    <li>We follow Shopify's best practices for app security and data protection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Subject Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As required by Shopify and applicable privacy laws (such as GDPR and CCPA), we respond to all data requests and deletion requests via Shopify's mandatory webhooks. Since we do not store any customer data, there is no data to delete or provide.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
